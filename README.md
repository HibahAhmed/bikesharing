- Import data into Tableau.
- Create and style worksheets, dashboards, and stories in Tableau.
- Use Tableau worksheets to display data in a professional way.
- Portray data accurately using Tableau dashboards.

## Result

The data story can be found [here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hibah.ahmed/viz/TableauModule_16486020197060/NYCCitibikeChallenge?publish=yes)

Some conclusions that were made from each sheet included:
- Most people tend to bike about 10-20 minutes.
- The males made up most of the bikers.
- There seemed to be more bikers during early morning as well as the evening time.
- The starting as well as the ending locations of the bikers are fairly close to one another. 
- Popularity of bike repairs in different areas

## Summary

Overall, Tableau was very helpful in displaying the findings for the Citi Bikes. We were able to find where the bikes are famously used in the cities including the starting and stopping locations. In average, the males tend to use the bikes way more than the females did. Lastly, it is important to note that most of the bike usage occurred early mornings and evening times when people seemed to get off work. Some ways to improve analysis include adding the weather to see how storms or the heat benefit how much the bikes are used. Another way to improve the analysis is by including the typical times people are getting off work/rushhour and see how that impacts the number of bikes being used.
